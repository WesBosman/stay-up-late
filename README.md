This is my first ever attempt at building an Electron application. I decided to build the smallest application I could think of which was an app that could keep a system running even when a machine has an automatic lockout. 

The app has two modes on/off and that is it those both have click events that toggle Electron's powerSaveBlocker.

I have tested the application in development mode on my Macbook Pro 2011. Going to try to export it to my Windows Laptop and test it at work.

Used Electron Forge to get up and running with a boilerplate quickly. Created the project and tested it in under an hour.
